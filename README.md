# Node.js Delta Sharing Connector

[Delta Sharing](https://delta.io/sharing) is an open protocol for secure real-time exchange of large datasets, which enables secure data sharing across different computing platforms. It lets organizations share access to existing [Delta Lake](https://delta.io) and [Apache Parquet](https://parquet.apache.org) tables with other organizations, who can then directly read the table in Pandas, Apache Spark, or any other software that implements the open protocol.

This is the Node.js client library for Delta Sharing, which lets you load shared tables as DataFrames using [Danfo.js](https://danfo.jsdata.org/).

## Installation and Usage

1. Download using `npm install delta-sharing`.
2. To use the Node.js Connector, see [the project docs](https://github.com/delta-io/delta-sharing) for details.
